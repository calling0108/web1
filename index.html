  <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="WEB bible specification">The World Wide Web (WWW), </a>
    commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other
    web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as <a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a>),
    which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2]
    The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
    may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are
    published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not
    synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades
    and upon which technologies the Web is built.
